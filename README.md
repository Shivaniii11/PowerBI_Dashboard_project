Insurance Analysis Dashboard built in Power BI. 

This dashboard is designed to transform raw insurance data into meaningful insights by analyzing claim status (settled, pending, rejected), tracking active vs. inactive policies, and evaluating premium, coverage, and claim amounts. It also provides a clear breakdown of policy performance across different policy types and age groups, helping to better understand customer behavior and business trends.

Working on this project allowed me to strengthen my skills in data cleaning, DAX calculations, and visualization design, while focusing on creating a user-friendly and interactive dashboard for decision-making. I truly enjoyed the process of turning complex datasets into a simple and insightful story, and I look forward to your valuable feedback and suggestions.
